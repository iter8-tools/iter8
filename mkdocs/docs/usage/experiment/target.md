# Target of the Experiment

!!! abstract "Target"
    `spec.target` identifies the app under experimentation and determines which experiments can run concurrently.

??? example "Sample experiment targeting a Knative service"
    ```yaml linenums="1" hl_lines="7"
    apiVersion: iter8.tools/v2alpha1
    kind: Experiment
    metadata:

    ```

## Target naming conventions
=== "Knative"
    When experimenting with a Knative service, the convention is to use the fully qualified name (namespace/name) of the Knative service as the target string. In the sample experiment above, the app under experimentation is the Knative service named `sample-app` under the `default` namespace. Hence, the target string is `default/sample-app`. 


## Concurrency policy
Experiments that have the same target value will **not** be scheduled concurrently but will be run sequentially in the order of their creation timestamps. Experiments whose target values differ from each other can be scheduled by Iter8 concurrently.
