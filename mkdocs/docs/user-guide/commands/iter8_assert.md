## iter8 assert

Assert if experiment result satisfies the specified conditions

### Synopsis


Assert if experiment result satisfies the specified conditions. 
If assert conditions are satisfied, exit with code 0. Else, exit with code 1. 
Assertions are especially useful within CI/CD/GitOps pipelines.

```
iter8 assert [flags]
```

### Examples

```

# assert that the experiment completed without failures, 
# and SLOs were satisfied
iter8 assert -c completed -c nofailure -c slos

# another way to write the above assertion
iter8 assert -c completed,nofailure,slos

# if the experiment involves multiple app versions, 
# SLOs can be asserted for individual versions
# for example, the following command asserts that
# SLOs are satisfied by version numbered 0
iter8 assert -c completed,nofailures,slosby=0

# timeouts are useful for an experiment that may be long running
# and may run in the background
iter8 assert -c completed,nofailures,slosby=0 -t 5s

```

### Options

```
  -c, --condition(s); can specify multiple or separate conditions with commas; strings   completed | nofailure | slos | slosby=<version number>
  -h, --help                                                                             help for assert
  -t, --timeout duration                                                                 timeout duration (e.g., 5s)
```
