## iter8 hub

download an experiment folder from Iter8 hub

### Synopsis


Download an experiment folder from the Iter8 hub. This is useful for fetching experiments to inspect, modify, run or repackage. By default, this command looks for the specified experiment folder in the public Iter8 hub. It is also possible to use custom hubs by setting the ITER8HUB environment variable.

Environment variables:

| Name               | Description |
|--------------------| ------------|
| $ITER8HUB          | Iter8 hub location. Default value: github.com/iter8-tools/iter8.git//mkdocs/docs/hub/ |

The Iter8 hub location follows the following syntax:

HOST/OWNER/REPO[?ref=branch]//path-to-experiment-folder-relative-to-root-of-the-repo

For example: github.com/iter8-tools/iter8.git?ref=master//mkdocs/docs/hub/


```
iter8 hub [flags]
```

### Examples

```

	# public hub
	iter8 hub -e load-test

	# custom hub
	# Suppose you forked github.com/iter8-tools/iter8, 
	# created a branch called 'ml', and pushed a new experiment folder 
	# called 'tensorflow' under the path 'mkdocs/docs/hub'. 
	# It can now be downloaded as follows.

	export ITER8HUB=github.com/iter8-tools/iter8.git?ref=ml//mkdocs/docs/hub/
	iter8 hub -e tensorflow
	
```

### Options

```
  -e, --experiment string   valid experiment folder located under hub
  -h, --help                help for hub
```
