## iter8 hub

Download an experiment folder from Iter8 hub

### Synopsis


	Download an experiment folder from the Iter8 hub. 
	This is useful for fetching experiments to inspect, modify, run, or repackage. 
	By default, this command looks for the specified experiment folder in the public Iter8 hub. 
	It is also possible to use custom hubs by setting the ITER8HUB environment variable.

	Environment variables:

	| Name               | Description |
	|--------------------| ------------|
	| $ITER8HUB          | Iter8 hub location. Default value: github.com/iter8-tools/iter8.git//hub |

	The Iter8 hub location follows the following syntax:

	HOST/OWNER/REPO[?ref=branch]//path-to-experiment-folder-relative-to-root-of-the-repo

	For example: github.com/iter8-tools/iter8.git?ref=master//hub


```
iter8 hub [flags]
```

### Examples

```

	# download load-test experiment folder from the public Iter8 hub
	iter8 hub -e load-test

	# custom Iter8 hubs are simply github repos that host Iter8 experiment folders
	# Suppose you forked github.com/iter8-tools/iter8, 
	# created a branch called 'ml', and pushed a new experiment folder 
	# called 'tensorflow' under the path 'mkdocs/docs/hub'. 
	# It can now be downloaded as follows.

	export ITER8HUB=github.com/iter8-tools/iter8.git?ref=ml//hub
	iter8 hub -e tensorflow
	
```

### Options

```
  -e, --experiment string   valid experiment folder located under hub
  -h, --help                help for hub
```
