# How Iter8 queries metrics

!!! abstract ""
    During an Iter8 experiment, in each iteration, for each version involved in the experiment, and for each metric referenced in the experiment, Iter8 uses an HTTP query to retrieve the current metric value. Iter8 constructs the parameters of this HTTP query by interpolating the `spec.params` field of the metric using variables associated with the version.

## How Iter8 interpolates `params`

* Each element of the [`spec.params` list](/reference/apispec/#spec_1) in the metric is a name-value pair. The value string is treated by Iter8 as a [`Python` string template](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#string.Template). Specifically, the value string may contain placeholders which are substrings that begin with the symbol `$`. This template is `interpolated`, i.e., its placeholders are substituted with actual values during query time as follows.
    - The `$interval` placeholder is substituted with the total time elapsed since the start of the experiment. All metrics are expected to use `$interval`; this is the length of the time window ending now, over which the metric value is computed.
    - The `$name` placeholder is substituted with the name of the version.
    - Any other placeholder is substituted with the value of the corresponding [variable associated with the version](/reference/apispec/#variable). If no such variable is associated with the version, then no substitution occurs.

## An end-to-end Iter8 metric query example

This example illustrates the end-to-end process of retrieving metric values in Iter8 experiments. Consider the sample metric and experiment snippets shown below.

??? example "Sample metric for illustrating param interpolation"
    ```yaml linenums="1"
    apiVersion: iter8.tools/v2alpha1
    kind: Metric
    metadata:
      name: my-metric
      namespace: iter8-knative-monitoring
    spec:
      params:
      - name: query
        value: sum(increase(revision_app_request_latencies_count{name='$name', namespace='$namespace'}[$interval])) or on() vector(0)
      description: my special metric
      type: counter
      provider: prometheus
    ```

??? example "Experiment snippet for illustrating param interpolation"
    ```yaml linenums="1" hl_lines="7 12 17 22"
    ...
    spec:
      ...
      versionInfo:         
        baseline: 
          # name of the version
          name: sample-app-v1
          variables:
          - name: sample-app-v1
            value: sample-app-v1 
          - name: namespace
            value: iter8-knative-monitoring
          - name: promote
            value: baseline
        candidates: 
          # name of the version
        - name: sample-app-v2
          variables:
          - name: revision
            value: sample-app-v2
          - name: namespace
            value: iter8-knative-monitoring
          - name: promote
            value: candidate 
      criteria:
        objectives: 
        - metric: iter8-knative-monitoring/my-metric
          upperLimit: 50
        - metric: iter8-knative-monitoring/95th-percentile-tail-latency
          upperLimit: 100
        - metric: iter8-knative-monitoring/error-rate
          upperLimit: "0.01"
        indicators:
        - iter8-knative-monitoring/75th-percentile-tail-latency
        - iter8-knative-monitoring/90th-percentile-tail-latency
        - iter8-knative-monitoring/99th-percentile-tail-latency
      ...
    status:
      initTime: "2020-12-27T21:55:48Z"
      ...
    ```

1. Iter8 retrieves the URL of the Prometheus metrics backend which is [configured as part of Iter8 install](/getting-started/install/#prometheus-url).


2. Suppose Iter8 is performing iteration 10 of the experiment. `iter8-knative-monitoring/my-metric` is referenced in the `spec.criteria` field of the experiment. When querying the value of this metric for the app version named `sample-app-v2`, Iter8 does the following.
    - Iter8 computes the time elapsed since the start of the experiment (i.e, `time.Now() - status.initTime`). Suppose this value equals 285 seconds; Iter8 substitutes `$interval` with `285s`.
    - Iter8 substitutes `$name` with `sample-app-v2`, the name associated with this version.
    - Iter8 substitutes `$namespace` with `iter8-knative-monitoring` which is the value of the `namespace` variable associated with the version named `sample-app-v2`. 
    - **Note:** The `name` and `namespace` values associated with versions are highlighted in the experiment snippet above.

3. Step 2 yields an HTTP query with a single HTTP query parameter named `query` with the following value:
``` shell
sum(increase(revision_app_request_latencies_count{name='sample-app-v2', namespace='iter8-knative-monitoring'}[285s])) or on() vector(0)
```
Iter8 sends an HTTP GET request to the Prometheus metrics backend (for example, `http://prometheus-operated.iter8-knative-monitoring:9090`) with an HTTP query parameter named `query`. The [response from Prometheus](/reference/metrics/custom-metrics/#prometheus-response) contains the current value of `my-metric` for `sample-app-v2`.
