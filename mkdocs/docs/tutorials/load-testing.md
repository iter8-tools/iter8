# Load Testing

Load testing experiments can generate requests for HTTP and gRPC services, collect built-in latency and error-related metrics and validate SLOs. 

***

## v0.8 Examples

* Load testing and SLO validation of an app with an [HTTP GET API endpoint](../getting-started/your-first-experiment.md).

***

## v0.7 Examples

* [HTTP POST API endpoint](https://iter8.tools/0.7/tutorials/deployments/slo-validation-payload/)

* [Knative app managed by Helm](https://iter8.tools/0.7/tutorials/knative/slovalidation-helmex/)
