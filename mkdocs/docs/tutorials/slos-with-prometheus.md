# SLOs with Prometheus

Metrics collection using Prometheus is a common feature provided many app frameworks, service meshes, and ingress technologies. Iter8 can query metrics from Prometheus and perform SLO validation based on metric values.

***

## v0.7 Examples

* SLO validation based on Prometheus metrics for [KServe ML models](https://iter8.tools/0.7/tutorials/kfserving/testing-strategies/hybrid/).

* SLO validation based on Prometheus metrics for [Seldon ML model deployments](https://iter8.tools/0.7/tutorials/seldon/quick-start/).

* SLO validation based on Prometheus metrics with [Istio service mesh](https://iter8.tools/0.7/tutorials/istio/testing-strategies/slovalidation/).

* SLO validation based on Prometheus metrics with [Linkerd service mesh](https://iter8.tools/0.7/tutorials/linkerd/abexperiment-helmex/).
