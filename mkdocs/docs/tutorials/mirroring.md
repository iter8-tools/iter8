# Mirroring

Traffic mirroring or shadowing enables experimenting with a dark launched version with zero-impact on end-users. Mirrored traffic is a replica of the real user requests that is routed to the dark version. Metrics are collected and evaluated for the dark version, but responses from the dark version are ignored.
