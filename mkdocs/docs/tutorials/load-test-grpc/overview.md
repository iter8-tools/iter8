# Overview

!!! tip "Load Testing and SLO Validation for gRPC Services"
    Iter8's gRPC load testing and SLO validation experiments can generate requests for gRPC services, collect built-in latency and error-related metrics, and validate service-level objectives (SLOs). This experiment can work with all four kinds of gRPC service methods, namely, unary, server-streaming, client-streaming, and bidirectional streaming.
    
    This experiment is illustrated in the figure below.

: Use an Iter8 experiment to load test a unary gRPC service and validate latency and error-related service level objectives (SLOs).
