# App/serverless/ML Frameworks

This tutorial provides examples of using the `load-test-http` experiment with various Kubernetes app/serverless/ML frameworks.

## Knative

???+ note "Before you begin"
    1. [Install Iter8](../../getting-started/install.md).
    2. [Install Knative and deploy your first Knative Service](https://knative.dev/docs/getting-started/first-service/). As noted at the end of the Knative tutorial, when you curl the Knative service,
    ```shell
    curl http://hello.default.127.0.0.1.sslip.io
    ```
    you should see the expected output as follows.
    ```
    Hello World!
    ```
    3. Download experiment chart.
    ```shell
    iter8 hub -e load-test-http
    cd load-test-http
    ```

### 1. Run experiment
```shell
iter8 run --set url=http://hello.default.127.0.0.1.sslip.io \
          --set SLOs.error-rate=0 \
          --set SLOs.latency-mean=50 \
          --set SLOs.latency-p90=100 \
          --set SLOs.latency-p'97\.5'=200
```

### 2. Assert outcomes
Assert that the experiment completed without any failures and SLOs are satisfied.

```shell
iter8 assert -c completed -c nofailure -c slos
```

### 3. View report
View a report of the experiment in HTML or text formats as follows.

=== "HTML"
    ```shell
    iter8 report -o html > report.html
    # open report.html with a browser. In MacOS, you can use the command:
    # open report.html
    ```

=== "Text"
    ```shell
    iter8 report -o text
    ```
