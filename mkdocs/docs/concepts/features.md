# Key Features

## A/B(/n) testing
Compare two or more versions of your app/ML model and identify the winning version based on business reward metrics using rigorous statistical analysis. Iter8's A/B(/n) experiments help you grow your business with every release of the app.

## SLO validation
Ensure that new app versions satisfy latency, error and other service-level objectives before they are released.

## Load testing/built-in metrics
Use Iter8's built-in mechanisms for generating load and collecting latency and error related metrics for APIs.

## Chaos testing
Chaos injection reveals weaknesses in your apps by pushing your app/cluster to the brink. Iter8's chaos testing experiments help you determine if your apps continue to satisfy SLOs amid chaos.

## Advanced traffic engineering
Use advanced traffic engineering features from your service mesh/ingress such as mirroring, traffic segmentation based on headers or cookies, and session affinity as part of Iter8 experiments.

## Progressive traffic shifting
Use Iter8's multi-armed bandit based AI to progressively shift traffic towards the winning version of your app.

## Hybrid experiments
Combine any of the above testing and rollout patterns within an experiment.

## CI/CD/GitOps
Embed Iter8 experiments within any CI/CD/GitOps process. Iter8 can automatically create pull requests, trigger GitHub actions workflows, and emit HTTP notifications at various stages of the experiment.

## App/ML/Serverless frameworks
Iter8 works with diverse app/ML/serverless frameworks. Experiment with Kubernetes deployments, Helm releases, Knative (serverless) services, KFServing (ML) inference services, Seldon (ML) deployments, and more.

## Metrics from any database
Use metrics from any database such as Prometheus, Elastic, New Relic, and Sysdig as part of Iter8 experiments.
