# Getting Help

1. Read [Iter8 docs](https://iter8.tools).
2. Join the [Iter8 Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/iter8-tools/shared_invite/zt-awl2se8i-L0pZCpuHntpPejxzLicbmw).
3. File an issue or start a discussion on the [Iter8 GitHub repo](https://github.com/iter8-tools/iter8).
4. Attend our weekly community meetings!

    - Everyone is welcome to join our community meetings. You never need an
    invite to attend. In fact, we want you to join us, even if you donâ€™t have
    anything you feel like you want to contribute. Just being there is enough!
    - Our community meetings are on Wednesday at 1PM EST/EDT. You can find the video
    conference link [here](https://meet.google.com/hys-ubrv-bsd). You can find the
    agenda [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1khHMD7JKt-kNAkbLgiIfwDbJYAhHMkyg?usp=sharing) as well as the meeting notes [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rVrheoO-nfUI7JdPEgCqM39rl59KrPBk?usp=sharing).
    - If you have a topic you would like to discuss, please put it on the agenda as 
    well as a time estimate. Community meetings will be recorded
    and publicly available on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVybpnQAhr1o-QRPHBNdUgg).
