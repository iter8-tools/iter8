# Design considerations

Iter8 v0.8 vastly simplifies metrics driven experiments, and introduces a way to perform experiments locally. Iter8 v0.7 will be actively maintained until v0.8 achieves feature parity with it, at which point v0.7 will be deprecated.

If the features you need are yet to become available in Iter8 v0.8, we recommend using v0.7 until such time when they become available in v0.8.
