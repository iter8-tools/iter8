# Motivation behind v0.8
Iter8 v0.8 vastly simplifies experiments, and introduces the ability to run Iter8 experiments on your local machine as well as in Kubernetes. 

Unlike Iter8 v0.7, running v0.8 experiments within Kubernetes does not require custom resources. Any user with permissions to create namespace-scoped resources (like jobs and secrets) can also run experiments inside the cluster.

## Status of Iter8 v0.7
Iter8 v0.7 will be actively maintained until v0.8 achieves feature parity with it, at which point v0.7 will be deprecated.

Please pardon our appearance until v0.7 tutorials are fully migrated to v0.8.
