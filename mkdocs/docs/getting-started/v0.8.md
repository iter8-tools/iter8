# Iter8 v0.8
Iter8 v0.8 vastly simplifies metrics driven experiments, and introduces the ability to run Iter8 experiments on your local machine as well as in Kubernetes. Moreover, in Iter8 v0.8,  running experiments within Kubernetes does not require custom resources. Any user with permissions to create namespace-scoped resources like jobs, secrets, and configmaps can also run experiments inside the cluster.

## Iter8 v0.7
Iter8 v0.7 will be actively maintained until v0.8 achieves feature parity with it, at which point v0.7 will be deprecated.
