# Your First Experiment

!!! tip "Load Test an HTTP Service"
    Get started with your first [Iter8 experiment](concepts.md#what-is-an-iter8-experiment) by load testing an HTTP service. 
    
***

## 1. Install Iter8
=== "Brew"
    Install the latest stable release of the Iter8 CLI using `brew` as follows.

    ```shell
    brew tap iter8-tools/iter8
    brew install iter8
    ```
    
=== "Binaries"
    Pre-compiled Iter8 binaries for many platforms are available [here](https://github.com/iter8-tools/iter8/releases). Uncompress the iter8-X-Y.tar.gz archive for your platform, and move the `iter8` binary to any folder in your PATH.

=== "Source"
    Build Iter8 from source as follows. Go `1.17+` is a pre-requisite.
    ```shell
    # you can replace master with a specific tag such as v0.8.29
    export REF=master
    https://github.com/iter8-tools/iter8.git?ref=$REF
    cd iter8
    make install
    ```

=== "Go 1.17+"
    Install the latest stable release of the Iter8 CLI using `go 1.17+` as follows.

    ```shell
    go install github.com/iter8-tools/iter8@latest
    ```
    You can now run `iter8` (from your gopath bin/ directory)

## 2. Launch experiment
We will load test the HTTP service whose URL (`url`) is https://httpbin.org/get. 

The `iter8 launch` command downloads an [experiment chart](concepts.md#experiment-chart) from [Iter8 hub](concepts.md#iter8-hub), combines the chart with values to generate the `experiment.yaml` file, runs the experiment, and writes results into the `result.yaml` file. Launch the load test experiment as follows.

```shell
iter8 launch -c load-test-http --set url=https://httpbin.org/get
```

## 3. View report
View a report containing the metrics collected during this experiment in HTML or text formats as follows.

=== "HTML"
    ```shell
    iter8 report -o html > report.html
    # open report.html with a browser. In MacOS, you can use the command:
    # open report.html
    ```

    ??? note "The HTML report looks like this"
        ![HTML report](images/report.html.png)

=== "Text"
    ```shell
    iter8 report
    ```

    ??? note "The text report looks like this"
        ```shell
        Experiment summary:

Congratulations! :tada: You completed your first Iter8 experiment.
