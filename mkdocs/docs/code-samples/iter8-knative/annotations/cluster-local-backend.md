# Experimenting with cluster-local (backend) services

Cluster local or backend services are private services which are only available inside the cluster.
Iter8 experiments with cluster-local Knative services are similar to any other Iter8 experiments. See [Knative docs](https://knative.dev/docs/serving/cluster-local-route/) for instructions on how to label a service to be cluster local.

Use this service in any Iter8 experiment with objectives of your choice.
