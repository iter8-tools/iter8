# Canary + Request Routing Tutorial

!!! tip ""
    Perform an Iter8-Knative experiment with [`Canary`](/concepts/experimentationstrategies/#testing-pattern) testing, [`Progressive`](/concepts/experimentationstrategies/#deployment-pattern) deployment and [request routing](/concepts/experimentationstrategies/#traffic-shaping).
    
    ![Canary](/assets/images/request-routing.png)

You will create the following resources in this tutorial.

1. **Knative services** implementing an app with `baseline` and `candidate` versions.
2. An  **Istio virtual service** which routes requests based an HTTP header called `country`. All requests are routed to the `baseline`, except those with their `country` header field set to `wakanda`; these may be routed to the `baseline` or `candidate`.
3. Two **curl-based traffic generators** which simulate user requests; one of them sets the `country` HTTP header field in its requests to `wakanda`, and the other sets it to `gondor`.
4. An **Iter8 experiment** which verifies that the `candidate` satisfies mean latency, 95th percentile tail latency, and error rate `objectives`, and progressively increases the proportion of traffic with `country: wakanda` header that is routed to the `candidate`.

??? warning "Before you begin, you will need ... "
    **Kubernetes cluster with Iter8, Knative and Istio:** Ensure that you have Kubernetes cluster with Iter8 and Knative installed, and that Knative uses the Istio networking layer. You can do this by following Steps 1, 2, and 3 of [the quick start tutorial for Knative](/getting-started/quick-start/with-knative/), and selecting `Istio` during Step 3.

    **Cleanup:** If you ran an Iter8 tutorial earlier, run the associated cleanup step.

    **ITER8:** Ensure that `ITER8` environment variable is set to the root directory of your cloned Iter8 repo. See [Step 2 of the quick start tutorial for Knative](/getting-started/quick-start/with-knative/#2-clone-repo) for example.


## 1. Create versions
```shell
kubectl apply -f $ITER8/samples/knative/requestrouting/services.yaml
```

??? info "Look inside services.yaml"
    ```yaml linenums="1"
    apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: sample-app-v1
      namespace: default
    spec:
      template:
        metadata:
          name: sample-app-v1-blue
          annotations:
            autoscaling.knative.dev/scaleToZeroPodRetentionPeriod: "10m"
        spec:
          containers:
          - image: gcr.io/knative-samples/knative-route-demo:blue 
            env:
            - name: T_VERSION
              value: "blue"
    ---
    apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: sample-app-v2
      namespace: default
    spec:
      template:
        metadata:
          name: sample-app-v2-green
          annotations:
            autoscaling.knative.dev/scaleToZeroPodRetentionPeriod: "10m"
        spec:
          containers:
          - image: gcr.io/knative-samples/knative-route-demo:green 
            env:
            - name: T_VERSION
              value: "green"
    ```


## 2. Create Istio virtual service
```shell
kubectl apply -f $ITER8/samples/knative/requestrouting/routing-rule.yaml
```

??? info "Look inside routing-rule.yaml"
    ```yaml linenums="1"
    apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3

      http:
      - match:
        - headers:
            country:
              exact: wakanda
        route:
        - destination:
            host: sample-app-v1.default.svc.cluster.local
          headers:
            request:
              set:
                Knative-Serving-Namespace: default
                Knative-Serving-Revision: sample-app-v1-blue
                Host: sample-app-v1.default
          weight: 100
        - destination:
            host: sample-app-v2.default.svc.cluster.local
          headers:
            request:
              set:

                Knative-Serving-Revision: sample-app-v2-green
                Host: sample-app-v2.default
          weight: 0
      - route:
        - destination:
            host: sample-app-v1.default.svc.cluster.local
          headers:
            request:
              set:
                Knative-Serving-Namespace: default
                Knative-Serving-Revision: sample-app-v1-blue
                Host: sample-app-v1.default
    ```

## 3. Generate traffic
```shell
TEMP_DIR=$(mktemp -d)
cd $TEMP_DIR
curl -L https://istio.io/downloadIstio | ISTIO_VERSION=1.8.2 sh -
istio-1.8.2/bin/istioctl kube-inject -f $ITER8/samples/knative/requestrouting/curl.yaml | kubectl create -f -
cd $ITER8
```

              while true; do
              curl -sS customdomain.com -H "country: gondor"
              sleep 1.0
              done
          - name: curl-from-wakanda
            image: tutum/curl
            command: 
            - /bin/sh
            - -c
            - |
              while true; do
              curl -sS customdomain.com -H "country: wakanda"
              sleep 0.25
              done
          restartPolicy: Never
    ```

## 4. Create Iter8 experiment
```shell
kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready ksvc/sample-app-v1
kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready ksvc/sample-app-v2
kubectl apply -f $ITER8/samples/knative/requestrouting/experiment.yaml

kubectl delete -f $ITER8/samples/knative/requestrouting/curl.yaml

kubectl delete -f $ITER8/samples/knative/requestrouting/services.yaml
```

??? info "Understanding what happened"
    1. You configured two Knative services corresponding to two versions of your app in `services.yaml`.

    2. You used `customdomain.com` as the HTTP host in this tutorial.
        - **Note:** In your production cluster, use domain(s) that you own in the setup of the virtual service.

    3. You set up an Istio virtual service which mapped the Knative services to this custom domain. The virtual service specified the following routing rules: all HTTP requests to `customdomain.com` with their Host header or :authority pseudo-header **not** set to `wakanda` would be routed to the `baseline`; those with `wakanda` Host header or :authority pseudo-header may be routed to `baseline` and `candidate`.
    
    4. The percentage of `wakandan` requests sent to `candidate` is 0% at the beginning of the experiment.

    5. You generated traffic for `customdomain.com` using a `curl`-job with two `curl`-containers to simulate user requests. You injected Istio sidecar injected into it to simulate traffic generation from within the cluster. The sidecar was needed in order to correctly route traffic. One of the `curl`-containers sets the `country` header field to `wakanda`, and the other to `gondor`.
        - **Note:** You used Istio version 1.8.2 to inject the sidecar. This version of Istio corresponds to the one installed in [Step 3 of the quick start tutorial](http://localhost:8000/getting-started/quick-start/with-knative/#3-install-knative-and-iter8). If you have a different version of Istio installed in your cluster, change the Istio version during sidecar injection appropriately.
    
    6. You created an Iter8 `Canary` experiment with `Progressive` deployment pattern to evaluate the `candidate`. In each iteration, Iter8 observed the mean latency, 95th percentile tail-latency, and error-rate metrics collected by Prometheus, and verified that the `candidate` version satisfied all the `objectives` specified in the experiment. It progressively increased the proportion of traffic with `country: wakanda` header that is routed to the `candidate`.
