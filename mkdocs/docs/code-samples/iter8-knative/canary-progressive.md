# Progressive Canary Deployment using Helm

Perform **zero-downtime progressive canary release of a Knative app**. This tutorial is similar to the [iter8 quick start tutorial for Knative](/getting-started/quick-start/with-knative/). You will create:

1. A Knative service with two versions of your app, namely, `baseline` and `candidate`
2. A traffic generator which sends HTTP GET requests to the Knative service.
3. An **iter8 experiment** that automates the following: 
    - verifies that latency and error-rate metrics for the `candidate` satisfy the given objectives
    - iteratively shifts traffic from `baseline` to `candidate`,
    - fine-tunes traffic shifting behavior during iterations using `spec.strategy.weights`, and
    - replaces `baseline` with `candidate` in the end using a `helm install` command

??? warning "Before you begin"
    **Kubernetes cluster:** Ensure that you have Kubernetes cluster with iter8 and Knative installed. You can do this by following Steps 1, 2, and 3 of [the quick start tutorial for Knative](/getting-started/quick-start/with-knative/).

    **Cleanup:** If you ran an iter8 tutorial earlier, run the associated cleanup step. For example, [Step 8](/getting-started/quick-start/with-knative/#8-cleanup) is the cleanup step for the iter8-Knative quick start tutorial.

    **ITER8:** Ensure that `ITER8` environment variable is set to the root directory of your cloned iter8 repo. See [Step 2 of the quick start tutorial for Knative](/getting-started/quick-start/with-knative/#2-clone-repo) for example.

    **[Helm v3](https://helm.sh/) and [iter8ctl](/getting-started/install/#step-4-install-iter8ctl):** This tutorial uses Helm v3 and iter8ctl. Install if needed.

## 1. Create Knative app with canary
```shell
helm install --repo https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iter8-tools/iter8/master/samples/knative/canaryprogressive/helm-repo sample-app sample-app --namespace=iter8-system
kubectl wait ksvc/sample-app --for condition=Ready --timeout=120s
helm upgrade --install --repo https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iter8-tools/iter8/master/samples/knative/canaryprogressive/helm-repo sample-app sample-app --values=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iter8-tools/iter8/master/samples/knative/canaryprogressive/experimental-values.yaml --namespace=iter8-system
```

??? info "Look inside values.yaml"
    ```yaml
    # default values used for installing sample-app Helm chart
    # using these values will create a baseline version (revision) that gets 100% of the traffic
    name: "sample-app-v1"
    image: "gcr.io/knative-samples/knative-route-demo:blue"
    tVersion: "blue"
    ```

??? info "Look inside experimental-values.yaml"
    ```yaml
    # values file used for upgrading sample-app Helm chart for use in iter8 experiment
    # using these values will create a candidate version (revision)
    # baseline still gets 100% of the traffic
    name: "sample-app-v2"
    image: "gcr.io/knative-samples/knative-route-demo:green"
    tVersion: "green"
    traffic:
    - tag: current
      revisionName: sample-app-v1
      percent: 100
    - tag: candidate
      latestRevision: true
      percent: 0
    ```

## 2. Generate requests
Verify Knative service is ready and generate requests to app using fortio.
```shell
kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready ksvc/sample-app
URL_VALUE=$(kubectl get ksvc sample-app -o json | jq .status.address.url)
sed "s+URL_VALUE+${URL_VALUE}+g" $ITER8/samples/knative/canaryprogressive/fortio.yaml | kubectl apply -f -
```

## 3. Create iter8 experiment
```shell
kubectl apply -f $ITER8/samples/knative/canaryprogressive/experiment.yaml
```
??? info "Look inside experiment.yaml"
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: iter8.tools/v2alpha1
    kind: Experiment

      name: canary-progressive

          maxCandidateWeightIncrement: 20
        actions:
          start: # run the following sequence of tasks at the start of the experiment
          - library: knative

          - library: common
            task: exec # promote the winning version using Helm upgrade
            with:
              cmd: helm

            value: candidate  
    ```

## 4. Observe experiment

You can observe the experiment in realtime. Open three *new* terminals and follow instructions in the three tabs below.

=== "iter8ctl"
    Periodically describe the experiment.
    ```shell
    while clear; do
    kubectl get experiment canary-progressive -o yaml | iter8ctl describe -f -
    sleep 10
    done
    ```

    ??? info "iter8ctl output"
        iter8ctl output will be similar to the following.
        ```shell

        +--------------------------------+---------+-----------+
        ```
        When the experiment completes (in ~ 2 mins), you will see the experiment stage change from `Running` to `Completed`.
   

=== "kubectl get experiment"

    ```shell
    kubectl get experiment canary-progressive --watch
    ```

    ??? info "kubectl get experiment output"
        kubectl output will be similar to the following.
        ```shell

        ```
        When the experiment completes (in ~ 4 mins), you will see the experiment stage change from `Running` to `Completed`.    

=== "kubectl get ksvc"

    ```shell
    kubectl get ksvc sample-app -o json --watch | jq .status.traffic
    ```

    ??? info "kubectl get ksvc output"
        kubectl output will be similar to the following.
        ```shell
        [
          {
            "latestRevision": false,
            "percent": 25,
            "revisionName": "sample-app-v1",
            "tag": "current",
            "url": "http://current-sample-app.default.example.com"

            "url": "http://candidate-sample-app.default.example.com"
          }
        ]
        ```

## 5. Cleanup
```shell
kubectl delete -f $ITER8/samples/knative/canaryprogressive/experiment.yaml
kubectl delete -f $ITER8/samples/knative/canaryprogressive/fortio.yaml
helm uninstall sample-app --namespace=iter8-system
```

??? info "Understanding what happened"
    1. You created a Knative service using `helm install` subcommand and upgraded the service to have both `baseline` and `candidate` versions (revisions) using `helm upgrade --install` subcommand. The ksvc is created in the `default` namespace. Helm release information is located in the `iter8-system` namespace specified by the `--namespace=iter8-system` flag.
    2. You created a load generator that sends requests to the Knative service. At this point, 100% of requests are sent to the baseline and 0% to the candidate.
    3. You created an iter8 experiment with the above Knative service as the `target` of the experiment. In each iteration, iter8 observed the `mean-latency`, `95th-percentile-tail-latency`, and `error-rate` metrics for the revisions (collected by Prometheus), ensured that the candidate satisfied all objectives specified in `experiment.yaml`, and progressively shifted traffic from baseline to candidate. You restricted the maximum weight (traffic percentage) of candidate during iterations at 75% and maximum increment allowed during a single iteration to 20% using the `spec.strategy.weights` stanza.
    4. At the end of the experiment, iter8 identified the candidate as the `winner` since it passed all objectives. iter8 decided to promote the candidate (roll forward) by using a `helm upgrade --install` command. Had the candidate failed to satisfy objectives, iter8 would have promoted the baseline (rolled back) instead.
