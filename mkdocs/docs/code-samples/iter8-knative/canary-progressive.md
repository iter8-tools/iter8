# Canary + Progressive + Helm Tutorial

!!! tip ""
    Perform an Iter8-Knative experiment with [`Canary`](/concepts/experimentationstrategies/#testing-pattern) testing, [`Progressive`](/concepts/experimentationstrategies/#deployment-pattern) deployment, and [`Helm` based version promotion](/concepts/experimentationstrategies/#version-promotion).
    
    ![Canary](/assets/images/canary-progressive-helm.png)

You will create the following resources in this tutorial.

1. A **Knative app (service)** with two versions (revisions).
2. A **fortio-based traffic generator** that simulates user requests.
3. An **Iter8 experiment** that: 
    - verifies that `candidate` satisfies mean latency, 95th percentile tail latency, and error rate `objectives`
    - progressively shifts traffic from `baseline` to `candidate`, subject to the limits placed by the experiment's `spec.strategy.weights` field
    - eventually replaces `baseline` with `candidate` using `Helm`

??? warning "Before you begin, you will need ... "
    **Kubernetes cluster:** Ensure that you have Kubernetes cluster with Iter8 and Knative installed. You can do this by following Steps 1, 2, and 3 of [the quick start tutorial for Knative](/getting-started/quick-start/with-knative/).

    **Cleanup:** If you ran an Iter8 tutorial earlier, run the associated cleanup step.

    **ITER8:** Ensure that `ITER8` environment variable is set to the root directory of your cloned Iter8 repo. See [Step 2 of the quick start tutorial for Knative](/getting-started/quick-start/with-knative/#2-clone-repo) for example.

    **[Helm v3](https://helm.sh/) and [iter8ctl](/getting-started/install/#step-4-install-iter8ctl):** This tutorial uses Helm v3 and iter8ctl.

## 1. Create app versions
```shell
helm install --repo https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iter8-tools/iter8/master/samples/knative/canaryprogressive/helm-repo sample-app sample-app --namespace=iter8-system
kubectl wait ksvc/sample-app --for condition=Ready --timeout=120s
helm upgrade --install --repo https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iter8-tools/iter8/master/samples/knative/canaryprogressive/helm-repo sample-app sample-app --values=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iter8-tools/iter8/master/samples/knative/canaryprogressive/experimental-values.yaml --namespace=iter8-system
```

??? info "Look inside values.yaml"
    ```yaml linenums="1"
    # default values used for installing sample-app Helm chart
    # using these values will create a baseline version (revision) that gets 100% of the traffic
    name: "sample-app-v1"
    image: "gcr.io/knative-samples/knative-route-demo:blue"
    tVersion: "blue"
    ```

??? info "Look inside experimental-values.yaml"
    ```yaml linenums="1"
    # values file used for upgrading sample-app Helm chart for use in Iter8 experiment
    # using these values will create a candidate version (revision)
    # baseline still gets 100% of the traffic
    name: "sample-app-v2"
    image: "gcr.io/knative-samples/knative-route-demo:green"
    tVersion: "green"
    traffic:
    - tag: current
      revisionName: sample-app-v1
      percent: 100
    - tag: candidate
      latestRevision: true
      percent: 0
    ```

## 2. Generate requests
```shell
kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready ksvc/sample-app
URL_VALUE=$(kubectl get ksvc sample-app -o json | jq .status.address.url)
sed "s+URL_VALUE+${URL_VALUE}+g" $ITER8/samples/knative/canaryprogressive/fortio.yaml | kubectl apply -f -
```

## 3. Create Iter8 experiment
```shell
kubectl apply -f $ITER8/samples/knative/canaryprogressive/experiment.yaml
```
??? info "Look inside experiment.yaml"

    ```

## 4. Observe experiment
Observe the experiment in realtime. Paste commands from the tabs below in separate terminals.

=== "iter8ctl"
    Periodically describe the experiment.
    ```shell
    while clear; do
    kubectl get experiment canary-progressive -o yaml | iter8ctl describe -f -
    sleep 4
    done
    ```

    ??? info "iter8ctl output"
        iter8ctl output will be similar to the following.
        ```shell

        ```
        When the experiment completes (in ~ 2 mins), you will see the experiment stage change from `Running` to `Completed`.   

=== "kubectl get experiment"
    ```shell
    kubectl get experiment canary-progressive --watch
    ```

    ??? info "kubectl get experiment output"
        kubectl output will be similar to the following.
        ```shell
        NAME                 TYPE     TARGET               STAGE     COMPLETED ITERATIONS   MESSAGE

        ```
        When the experiment completes (in ~ 2 mins), you will see the experiment stage change from `Running` to `Completed`.    

=== "kubectl get ksvc"
    ```shell
    kubectl get ksvc sample-app -o json --watch | jq .status.traffic
    ```

    ??? info "kubectl get ksvc output"
        kubectl output will be similar to the following.
        ```shell
        [
          {
            "latestRevision": false,
            "percent": 25,
            "revisionName": "sample-app-v1",

            "url": "http://candidate-sample-app.default.example.com"
          }
        ]
        ```
        
## 5. Cleanup
```shell
kubectl delete -f $ITER8/samples/knative/canaryprogressive/experiment.yaml
kubectl delete -f $ITER8/samples/knative/canaryprogressive/fortio.yaml
helm uninstall sample-app --namespace=iter8-system
```

??? info "Understanding what happened"
    1. You created a Knative service using `helm install` subcommand and upgraded the service to have two revisions, sample-app-v1 (`baseline`) and sample-app-v2 (`candidate`) using `helm upgrade --install` subcommand. 
    2. The ksvc is created in the `default` namespace. Helm release information is located in the `iter8-system` namespace as specified by the `--namespace=iter8-system` flag.
    3. You generated requests for the Knative service using a fortio-job. At the start of the experiment, 100% of the requests are sent to baseline and 0% to candidate.
    4. You created an Iter8 `Canary` experiment with `Progressive` deployment pattern. In each iteration, Iter8 observed the mean latency, 95th percentile tail-latency, and error-rate metrics collected by Prometheus, verified that `candidate` satisfied all the objectives specified in the experiment, identified `candidate` as the `winner`, progressively shifted traffic from `baseline` to `candidate` and eventually promoted the `candidate` using `helm upgrade --install` subcommand.
        - **Note:** Had `candidate` failed to satisfy `objectives`, then `baseline` would have been promoted.
        - **Note:** You limited the maximum weight (traffic %) of `candidate` during iterations at 75% and maximum increment allowed during a single iteration to 20% using the field `spec.strategy.weights`. Traffic shifts during the experiment obeyed these limits.
