# values for the SLO validation experiment
experiment:
  # This experiment will collect Iter8's built-in latency and error metrics.
  # Time is the duration over which queries will be sent for metrics collection.
  # QPS is number of queries per second that will used for metrics collection.
  # By default, there will be 8.0 * 5 = 40 queries used for metrics collection.
  Time: 5s
  QPS: 8.0
  LimitMeanLatency: 500.0 # (msec) acceptable limit for mean latency
  LimitErrorRate: 0.01 # (msec) acceptable error rate is 1%
  Limit95thPercentileLatency: 1000.0 # (msec) acceptable limit for 95th percentile latency
