# to change the defaults, either modify experiment.yaml, or 
# uncomment the following lines and modify the values below

# experiment:
#   # The SLO validation experiment will collect Iter8's built-in latency and error metrics.
#   # There will be 8.0 * 5 = 40 queries sent during metrics collection.
#   # Time is the duration over which queries are sent during metrics collection.
#   Time: 5s
#   # QPS is number of queries per second sent during metrics collection.
#   QPS: 8.0
#   # (msec) acceptable limit for mean latency of the application
#   LimitMeanLatency: 500.0
#   # (msec) acceptable error rate for the application (1%)
#   LimitErrorRate: 0.01 
#   # (msec) acceptable limit for 95th percentile latency of the application
