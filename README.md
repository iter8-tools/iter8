## :dart: Features at a glance

**Load testing with SLOs**

  > Iter8 experiments can generate requests for HTTP and gRPC services, collect built-in latency and error-related metrics, and validate SLOs.

**A/B(/n) testing**

  > Grow your business with every release. Iter8 experiments can compare multiple versions based on business value and identify a winner.

**Simple to use**

  > Get started with Iter8 in seconds using pre-packaged experiment charts. Run Iter8 experiments locally, inside Kubernetes, or inside your CI/CD/GitOps pipelines.

**App frameworks**

  > Use with any app, serverless, or ML framework. Iter8 works with Kubernetes deployments, statefulSets, Knative services, KServe/Seldon ML deployments, or other custom Kubernetes resource types.
