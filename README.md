> Safely rollout new versions of apps and ML models. Maximize business value with each release.


## Use Cases

1.  Load testing with SLOs
2.  A/B(/n) testing for improving business value with each release of app/ML model
3.  Safe rollout for multi-cluster and edge
4.  Traffic mirroring experiments

The traffic mirroring use-case is achieved by using Iter8 along with a Kubernetes service mesh or ingress that supports mirroring.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Iter8
#### Using Brew
```shell
brew tap iter8-tools/iter8
brew install iter8
```

#### Using Go 1.16+
```shell
go install github.com/iter8-tools/iter8@latest
```
You can now run `iter8` (from your gopath bin/ directory)

#### Using pre-compiled binary
Pre-compiled Iter8 binaries for many platforms are available [here](https://github.com/iter8-tools/iter8/releases). Uncompress the iter8-X-Y.tar.gz archive for your platform, and move the `iter8` binary to any folder in your PATH.

## 2. Download experiment chart
Download the `load-test` experiment chart from Iter8 hub as follows.

```shell
iter8 hub -e load-test
```

This creates a local folder called `load-test` containing the chart.

## 3. Run experiment
The `iter8 run` command generates the `experiment.yaml` file from an experiment chart, runs the experiment, and writes the results of the experiment into the `result.yaml` file. Run the load test experiment as follows.

```shell
cd load-test
iter8 run --set url=https://example.com
```

## 4. Assert outcomes
Assert that the experiment completed without any failures and SLOs are satisfied.

```shell
iter8 assert -c completed -c nofailure -c slos
```

The `iter8 assert` subcommand asserts if experiment result satisfies the specified conditions. 
If assert conditions are satisfied, it exits with code `0`, and exits with code `1` otherwise. Assertions are especially useful within CI/CD/GitOps pipelines.

## 5. Generate report
Generate a report of the experiment in HTML or text formats as follows.

### HTML Report

```shell
iter8 report -o html > report.html
# open report.html with a browser. In MacOS, you can use the command:
# open report.html
```

The HTML report looks as follows.

### Text Report

```shell
iter8 report -o text
```

Congratulations! :tada: You completed your first Iter8 experiment.
