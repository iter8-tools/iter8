# Iter8-in-Docker-in-Tekton

Iter8 experiments can be performed for remote applications. In particular, Iter8 can be run in a local cluster while the application/ML model resides in a remote K8s cluster. In these situations, it is desirable to run Iter8 within a local cluster like Minikube or Kind which itself is running within a Docker container.

[This Dockerfile](https://github.com/iter8-tools/iter8/blob/master/install/docker/README.md) creates an Iter8-in-Docker (`iter8/ind`) image for the above scenario.

***

> The samples in this folder show how to use the `iter8/ind` image within Tekton. 

***

## Running ind-in-Tekton

1. [Install Tekton in K8s and setup Tekton CLI](https://tekton.dev/docs/getting-started/#prerequisites)

2. Clone the Iter8 repo locally.
```shell
export ITER8=<root-of-your-local-Iter8-repo>/samples/tekton
```

3. Run your first ind-in-Tekton workflow
```shell
kubectl apply -f $ITER8/task-iter8.yaml
```

Start the above task with `tkn`.

```shell
tkn task start iter8
```

Tekton will now start running your Task. To see the logs of the last TaskRun, run the following `tkn` command:

```shell
tkn taskrun logs --last -f 
```

It will take a couple of minutes for your Task to complete. When it executes, it should show output that resembles the following:

```shell
[iter8] + /iter8/iter8.sh
