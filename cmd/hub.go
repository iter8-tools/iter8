Download an experiment folder from Iter8 Hub. This is useful for fetching experiments to inspect, modify, run or repackage. By default, this command looks for the specified experiment folder in the public Iter8 hub. It is also possible to use private hubs by setting the ITER8HUB environment variable.

Environment variables:

| Name               | Description |
|--------------------| ------------|
| $ITER8HUB          | Iter8 hub location. Default value: github.com/iter8-tools/iter8.git//mkdocs/docs/hub/ |
