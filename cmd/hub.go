This command downloads an Iter8 experiment chart to a local directory.

		$	iter8 hub -c load-test-http

By default, the hub command downloads charts from the official Iter8 chart repo. It is also possible to use third party (helm) repos to host Iter8 experiment charts.

		$	iter8 hub -c great-expectations --repoURL https://great.expectations.pip --destDir /tmp

This command is primarily intended for development and testing of Iter8 experiment charts. For production usage, the iter8 launch command is recommended.
