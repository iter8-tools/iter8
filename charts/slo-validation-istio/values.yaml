### SLOs    A map of service level objectives (SLOs) that the app needs to satisfy.
### Metrics collected during the load test are used to verify if the app satisfies SLOs.
### Each SLO has a key which is the metric name, 
### and a value which is the upper limit on the metric.
### Valid metric names are error-rate, error-count, latency-max, 
### latency-mean, latency-stddev, and latency-pX, where X is any latency percentile 
### (i.e., any float value between 0 and 100).
### Unit of latency is msec.
### Example:
###   http/error-rate: 0
###   http/latency-mean: 50
###   http/latency-p99: 200

  istio/error-rate: 0
