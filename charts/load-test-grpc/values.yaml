### All parameters accepted by this chart (with the exception of SLOs), and their default values are documented here. In particular, please refer to the json/yaml tags of the fields:

### SLOs  A map of service level objectives (SLOs) that the app needs to satisfy.
### Keys are metric names. Values are acceptable upper limits for the metric.
### Valid metric names are grpc/error-rate, grpc/error-count, 
### grpc/latency/max, grpc/latency/mean, grpc/latency/stddev, and grpc/latency/pX, 
### where X is any percentile (i.e., any float value between 0 and 100).
### Unit of latency is msec.
### Example:
###   grpc/error-rate: 0
###   grpc/latency/mean: 50
###   grpc/latency/p99: 200
SLOs: null
