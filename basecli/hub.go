	Download an experiment folder from the Iter8 hub. 
	This is useful for fetching experiments to inspect, modify, run, or repackage. 
	By default, this command looks for the specified experiment folder in the public Iter8 hub. 
	It is also possible to use custom hubs by setting the ITER8HUB environment variable.

	Environment variables:

	| Name               | Description |
	|--------------------| ------------|
	| $ITER8HUB          | Iter8 hub location. Default value: github.com/iter8-tools/iter8.git//hub |

	The Iter8 hub location follows the following syntax:

	HOST/OWNER/REPO[?ref=branch]//path-to-experiment-folder-relative-to-root-of-the-repo

	For example: github.com/iter8-tools/iter8.git?ref=master//hub
`

	iter8 hub -e load-test

	# custom Iter8 hubs are simply github repos that host Iter8 experiment folders
	# Suppose you forked github.com/iter8-tools/iter8, 
	# created a branch called 'ml', and pushed a new experiment folder 
	# called 'tensorflow' under the path 'mkdocs/docs/hub'. 
	# It can now be downloaded as follows.
