# Default values for load-test.

# HTTP(S) URL where the app receives GET or POST requests.
# This field is required.
# Uncomment and edit the following line to set this field
# url: https://example.com

# HTTP headers to be used in requests sent to the app.
# Specified as a map with key being header names, and values being header values.
# Uncomment and edit the following map to set this field.
# headers:
#   hello: "mars"
#   goodbye: "pluto"

# Number of requests sent to the app.
numQueries: 100

# Duration for which requests are sent to the app.
# Value can be any Go duration string (https://pkg.go.dev/maze.io/x/duration#ParseDuration)
# This field is ignored if `numQueries` is specified.
duration: 10s

# Number of requests per second sent to each version.
qps: 10.0

# Number of parallel connections used to send requests.
connections: 4

# String data to be sent as payload. 
# If this field is specified, Iter8 will send HTTP POST requests.
# with this string as the payload.
# This field is ignored if `payloadURL` is specified.
# Uncomment and edit the following line to set this field.
# payloadStr: "abc123"

# URL of payload. If this field is specified, 
# Iter8 will send HTTP POST requests to versions with 
# data downloaded from this URL as the payload.
# Uncomment and edit the following line to set this field.
# payloadURL: "https://www.my.image.com/image.png"

# The type of the payload. Indicated using the Content-Type HTTP header value. 
# This is intended to be used in conjunction with one of the `payload*` fields above. 
# If this field is specified, Iter8 will send HTTP POST requests to versions 
# with this content type header value. If payload is supplied, and this field is omitted, 
# it will be defaulted to "application/octet-stream".
# Uncomment and edit the following line to set this field.
# contentType: "image/png"

# A list of error ranges. 
# Each range specifies an upper and/or lower limit on HTTP status codes. 
# HTTP responses that fall within these error ranges are considered error.
# The following setting says that HTTP status codes 500 or above are errors.
# Uncomment and edit the following lines to set this field.
# errorRanges:
# - lower: 500

# A list of latency percentiles computed by this load-test.
# Percentiles have single digit precision.
percentiles: [50.0, 75.0, 90.0, 95.0]

# A list of service level objectives (SLOs) that the app needs to satisfy.
# Metrics collected during the load test are used to verify if the app satisfies SLOs.
SLOs:
- metric: "built-in/error-rate"
  # error rate must be 0
  upperLimit: 0
- metric: "built-in/mean-latency"
  # mean latency must be under 50 msec
  upperLimit: 50
- metric: "built-in/p95.0"
  # 95th percentile latency must be under 100 msec
  upperLimit: 100
