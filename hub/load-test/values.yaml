### Defaults values for this experiment chart.

### The documentation follows Helm recommendations described in the URL below.
### https://helm.sh/docs/chart_best_practices/values/#document-valuesyaml 

### If a comment line starts with a single `#`, it denotes a setting for a value.
### You can uncomment such lines and edit the value(s).
### In contrast, general comment lines (like the current line) start with three or more `#`

##################################

### url   HTTP(S) URL where the app receives GET or POST requests.
### This field is required.

# url: https://httpbin.org/get

### headers   HTTP headers to be used in requests sent to the app.
### Specified as a map with key being header names, and values being header values.

# headers:
#   hello: "mars"
#   goodbye: "pluto"

### numQueries    Number of requests sent to the app. Default is 100

# numQueries: 100

### duration    Duration for which requests are sent to the app.
### Value can be any Go duration string (https://pkg.go.dev/maze.io/x/duration#ParseDuration)
### This field is ignored if `numQueries` is specified.

# duration: 10s

### qps   Number of requests per second sent to each version. Default is 8.0

# qps: 8.0

### connections   Number of parallel connections used to send requests. Default is 4

### connections: 4

### payloadStr    String data to be sent as payload. 
### If this field is specified, Iter8 will send HTTP POST requests.
### with this string as the payload.
### This field is ignored if `payloadURL` is specified.

# payloadStr: "abc123"

### payloadUrl    URL of payload. If this field is specified, 
### Iter8 will send HTTP POST requests to versions with 
### data downloaded from this URL as the payload.

# payloadURL: "https://www.my.image.com/image.png"

### contentType   The type of the payload. Indicated using the Content-Type HTTP header value. 
### This is intended to be used in conjunction with one of the `payload*` fields above. 
### If this field is specified, Iter8 will send HTTP POST requests to versions 
### with this content type header value. If payload is supplied, and this field is omitted, 
### it will be defaulted to "application/octet-stream".

# contentType: "image/png"

### errorRanges   A list of error ranges. 
### Each range specifies an upper and/or lower limit on HTTP status codes. 
### HTTP responses that fall within these error ranges are considered error.
### By default, status codes 400 and above are considered as errors.
### The following setting says that HTTP status codes 500 or above are errors.

# errorRanges:
# - lower: 500

### percentiles   A list of latency percentiles collected by this load-test.
### The following precentiles are always collecteed: [50.0, 75.0, 90.0, 95.0, 99.0, 99.9] 
### Additional percentile values can be specified in the following list

# percentiles: [25, 97.5]

### SLOs    A map of service level objectives (SLOs) that the app needs to satisfy.
### Metrics collected during the load test are used to verify if the app satisfies SLOs.
### Each SLO has a key which is the metric name, 
### and a value which is the upper limit on the metric.
### Valid metric names are error-rate, error-count, mean-latency, 
### and pX, where X is any latency percentile (float value between 0 and 100).

# SLOs:
#   error-rate: 0 # error rate must be 0
#   mean-latency: 50 # mean latency must be under 50 msec
#   p95.0: 200 # 95th percentile latency must be under 200 msec
