### Defaults values and behaviors of various parameters that can be set
### for this experiment chart.

### The documentation follows Helm recommendations described in the URL below.
### https://helm.sh/docs/chart_best_practices/values/#document-valuesyaml 

### If a comment line starts with a single `#`, it denotes a setting for a value.
### You can uncomment such lines and edit the value(s).
### In contrast, general comment lines (like the current line) start with three or more `#`

##################################

### host  Host and port of the gRPC service
### This field is required.

# host: 127.0.0.1:50051

### call  Fully-qualified method name.
### Specified in 'package.Service/method' or 'package.Service.Method' format.

# call: helloworld.Greeter.SayHello

### protoURL  URL where the Protocol Buffer file that defines the gRPC service is located.

# protoURL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grpc/grpc-go/master/examples/helloworld/helloworld/helloworld.proto

### connect-timeout  Connection timeout duration for the initial connection dial. Default is 10s.

# connect-timeout: 20s

### SLOs    A map of service level objectives (SLOs) that the app needs to satisfy.
### Metrics collected during the load test are used to verify if the app satisfies SLOs.
### Each SLO has a key which is the metric name, 
### and a value which is the upper limit on the metric.
### Valid metric names are error-rate, error-count, latency/max, latency/mean, 
### latency/stddev, and latency/pX, where X is any latency percentile 
### (i.e., any float value between 0 and 100).

# SLOs:
#   error-rate: 0 # error rate must be 0; every non-OK response is an error
#   latency/mean: 50 # mean latency must be under 50 msec
#   latency/p95.0: 200 # 95th percentile latency must be under 200 msec
