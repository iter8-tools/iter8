## Development environment setup

The Iter8 project consists of the following repos.

1. [iter8-tools/iter8](https://github.com/iter8-tools/iter8): source for the Iter8 CLI, Iter8 service and Iter8 experiment chart
2. [iter8-tools/docs](https://github.com/iter8-tools/docs): source for Iter8 docs

### iter8-tools/iter8

[This](https://github.com/iter8-tools/iter8) is the GitHub repo for Iter8 CLI, Iter8 service, and Iter8 experiment chart.

#### Build Iter8

```shell
go build
```

#### Install Iter8 locally

```shell

make coverage
make htmlcov
```

### iter8-tools/docs

## Sign Your Commits

Licensing is important to open source projects. It provides some assurances that
the software will continue to be available based under the terms that the
author(s) desired. We require that contributors sign off on commits submitted to
our project's repositories. The [Developer Certificate of Origin
(DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/) is a way to certify that you wrote and
have the right to contribute the code you are submitting to the project.

Read [GitHub's documentation on signing your commits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits).

You sign-off by adding the following to your commit messages. Your sign-off must
match the Git user and email associated with the commit.

    This is my commit message

    Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.name@example.com>

Git has a `-s` command line option to do this automatically:

    git commit -s -m 'This is my commit message'

If you forgot to do this and have not yet pushed your changes to the remote
repository, you can amend your commit with the sign-off by running:

    git commit --amend -s
