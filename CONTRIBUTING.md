### Your first contribution

We use [ZenHub](https://www.zenhub.com) to manage our issues and plan our feature releases. You can find our ZenHub board [here](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/iter8-5e8231e5559a7027a3e7a971/board). 

For beginners, we recommend first taking a look at issues with the [`help wanted`](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/iter8-5e8231e5559a7027a3e7a971/board?labels=help wanted) or [`good first issue`](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/iter8-5e8231e5559a7027a3e7a971/board?labels=good first issue) labels.

If you have questions about any issues, please leave a comment and one of the maintainers will clarify it. If you need a quicker response, please leave a comment in [our Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/iter8-tools/shared_invite/enQtODU0NTczMTQ5NDU4LTJmNGE1OTBhOWI4NzllZGE0ZjdhM2M3MzJlMjcxYjliMTJlM2YxMzQ4OWQ5NGViYTM2MTU4MWRkZTgxNzZiMzg).
